                <p class="fadeInUp aboutbio">I'm Hammad Khalid, but you can call me just Hammad.</p>
                <p class="fadeInUp aboutbio" style="margin-top:3%">About myself, I have completed my bachelors degree from Ghulam Ishak Khan institute (GIKI) in electrical engineering with major in electronics. My creative and innovative mindset is what that lands me on this feild. As from the begininning I was the person who love to create things from scratch and keep himself motivated by achieving different milestones during the whole process. The website in front of you is also an example of my this trait. </p>
                <p class="fadeInUp aboutbio" style="margin-top:3%">During my academic period I have completed alot of projects in which some of them were part of my curriculum while others were applications of my self learning. Some of them I have mentioned in the projects section. Besides academics web development is my passion. I always found it fascinating that how front end of website works, how our queries goes to databases, what kind of data is stored in data bases and i knew that there is only one way to find answers to all those questions and then my inquisitive nature made me to learn front end and back end languages. Some of those are listed in the skills section of this site. </p>
                <p class="fadeInUp aboutbio" style="margin-top:3%">Talking about experince, I have completed two internships in which one was IT based and other was subject relevant. You can check my resume if you want to know further details. Besides, I was also the executive member of GIKI robotics team (Techno Bolt) that gave me the chance to further polish myself. Learned alot from there and made several projects like line tracking robot, obstacle avoidng robot, RC cars. They shaped my personality by improving my leadership qualities, communication skills and ehanced my confidence level. Being an executive member I was also responsible for conducting technical workshops and events. </p>
